# Simple Beamer Template MUEXLY

Beamer is a LaTeX document class designed for creating slides for presentations.

The main advantages of using Beamer over PowerPoint include LaTeX being a simple, lightweight, platform-agnostic language, and its ability to generate a compiled PDF file that can be viewed on any computer. You do not need access to PowerPoint software to view the slides.

However, the downsides of using Beamer include the inability to embed videos or animations in the slides.

# How to use
A simple Makefile code is provided for your convenience. The code is straightforward, allowing you to read and understand it immediately. You can compile the .tex file using the following command:

```bash
> make
```
